We do not longer maintain ChangeLog files used to
be generated from the git history.
User-visible changes can be found in the NEWS.md file
distributed with the Lepton EDA suite and installed
to $PREFIX/share/doc/lepton-eda/.
Consult the detailed history on github project's
page [1] or clone the repository [2] and use
'git log' and 'git whatchanged' commands.
Old changelogs (<= 2007) are stored in the
docs/changelogs/ directory in the source tree.
