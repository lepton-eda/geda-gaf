LEPTON-ATTRIB

lepton-attrib is Lepton's spreadsheet attribute editor.  It reads
a set of schematic files (.sch), and creates a spreadsheet showing
all components in rows, with the associated component attributes
listed in the columns.  It allows the user to add, modify, or
delete component attributes outside of lepton-schematic, and then
save the .sch files back out.  lepton-attrib is useful in
situations where you need to view, add, modify, or delete a number
of attributes all at once.


WARNING: lepton-attrib has been tested on many designs, but is not
guaranteed to work properly in all cases.  Always keep a back-up
copy of your design files.  Note that this is good advice when
using any software on critical files.

Please see the Lepton EDA reference manual for more information.

CREDITS

The predecessor or lepton-attrib, gattrib, was cobbled together by
Stuart Brorson starting in December 2003 from parts culled from
GtkSheet (GTK+Extra) and gEDA.
