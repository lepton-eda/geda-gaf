.SH NAME
lepton-symcheck \- Lepton EDA Symbol Checker
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lepton-symcheck
.RB [ \-h ]
.RB [ \-v ]
.RB [ \-q ]
.I symbol1
.RI [... symbolN ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B lepton-symcheck
is a symbol checker for Lepton EDA.
Here is a list of checks that
.B lepton-symcheck
performs:

.IP \[bu] 2
Checks for \f[I]graphical\f[] attribute (if present does varied tests)
.IP \[bu]
Checks for the \f[I]device\f[] attribute
.IP \[bu]
Checks for various other missing attributes (\f[I]pinlabel\f[],
\f[I]pintype\f[], \f[I]pinseq\f[], \f[I]footprint\f[],
\f[I]refdes\f[])
.IP \[bu]
Checks to make sure that the active pin end is on the 100 unit
grid.
.IP \[bu]
Checks the uses of the various attributes (duplicates, incorrect
syntax, invalid values, etc...)
.IP \[bu]
Checks for obsolete, old, and forbidden attributes
.IP \[bu]
Checks for any nets or buses within a symbol
.IP \[bu]
Checks for any other connections within a symbol
.IP \[bu]
Checks to make sure the number of pins is the correct number

.SH OPTIONS
.B lepton-symcheck
accepts the following options:
.TP 8
.BR \-q ", " \-\-quiet
Quiet mode on.  This mode turns off all warnings/notes/messages. (optional)
.TP 8
.BR \-v ", " \-\-verbose
Verbose mode 1.  This mode will show all error messages (optional)
.TP 8
.B -vv
Verbose mode 2.  This mode will show all error and warning messages (optional)
.TP 8
.B -vvv
Verbose mode 2.  This mode will show all error, warning, and info
messages (optional)
.TP 8
.BR -h ", " \-\-help
Usage summary /
.B lepton-symcheck
help
.TP 8
.IR symbol1 " [..." symbolN ]
At least one symbol file must be specified.
If multiple symbols are
specified then they are sequentially read in and checked.
It is important that the schematic(s) follow all the options (i.e. last).

.SH EXAMPLES
Here are some examples on how to run
.BR lepton-symcheck :

To get usage information just run:

.RS
lepton-symcheck
.RE

To actually check a symbol with just error counts, run:

.RS
lepton-symcheck \f[I]symbolfilename.sym\f[]
.RE

To get the actuall error messages, run:

.RS
lepton-symcheck \-v \f[I]symbolfilename.sym\f[]
.RE

To see all the error messages and warnings, run:

.RS
lepton-symcheck \-vv \f[I]symbolfilename.sym\f[]
.RE

To see all the error messages, warnings, and parse info, run:

.RS
lepton-symcheck \-vvv \f[I]symbolfilename.sym\f[]
.RE

.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.B lepton-symcheck
respects the following environment variable:
.PP
.TP 8
.B GEDADATA
specifies where the various required scheme and rc files are located
(the default is ${prefix}/share/gEDA).  This environment variables does
not need to be set by the end user unless they are moving the executables
to a new install ${prefix}.
