;;; Source library is a list of directories to search for source
;;; files by their basenames. The directories are searched for
;;; files recursively. First found file with a given basename is
;;; returned.
;;; If any given directory is not readable, error is returned.
;;; If there are several files with the same given basename,
;;; a warning is output that some of those files won't be used.
