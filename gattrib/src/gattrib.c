 * \section sdb_notes SDB's original comment in gattrib.c
 *
 * In the spirit of open source/free software, major sections of
 * gattrib's code were borrowed from other sources, and hacked
 * together by SDB in Dec. 2003.  Particularly rich sources for code were
 * gEDA/gnetlist, and the gtkextra program testgtksheet.c.  Thanks to their
 * authors for providing the foundation upon which this is built.
 *
 * Of course, I *did* write major portions of the code too . . . . .
 * Some documentation about the internal operation of this program can be
 * found in the "NOTES" file  in the gattrib top-level directory.
 * -- SDB  December 2003 -
 *
 * \section ml_notes Architecture
 *
 * (extracted from SDB's mailing list posting:
 *  http://osdir.com/ml/cad.geda.devel/2007-06/msg00282.html - believed to
 *  still be relevant)
 *
 * gattrib has three major components:
 *
 * -# It manipulates objects held in the TOPLEVEL data structure. It
 *    does this by importing structs and functions from libgeda.
 * -# Gattrib defines its own layer of structs, notably SHEET_DATA,
 *    which holds a table of attrib name=value pairs, and also holds a
 *    couple of linked lists corresponding to all component's refdeses, and
 *    to all attribute names found in the design. This stuff is native to
 *    gattrib.
 * -# Gattrib uses a spreadsheet widget called GtkSheet. This stuff
 *    came from the GtkExtra project, which at one time offered a bunch of
 *    interesting widgets for graphing and visualization. I think they're
 *    still around; you can do a Google search for them. I stole the two
 *    .h files defining the spreadsheet widgets, and also stole code from
 *    the program itself to implement the run-time functions which deal with
 *    the spreadsheet.
 *
 * When run, gattrib does this:
 *
 * -# It uses libgeda functions to read in your design, and fill up the
 *    TOPLEVEL struct.
 * -# It then loops over everything in TOPLEVEL and fills out the refdes
 *    list and the attribute name list. It sticks these into a STRING_LIST
 *    which is associated with the SHEET_DATA struct.
 * -# Then, knowing all the refdeses and all the attribute names, it
 *    creates a TABLE data struct (a member of SHEET_DATA), and loops over
 *    each cell in the TABLE. For each cell, it queries TOPLEVEL for the
 *    corresponding name=value pair, and sticks the value in the TABLE.
 * -# When done with that, it then creates a GtkSheet and populates it
 *    by looping over TABLE.
 * -# Then it turns over control to the user, who can manipulate the
 *    GtkSheet. As the user adds and deletes values from the GtkSheet, the
 *    values are stored locally there. The GtkSheet is the master
 *    repository of all attributes at that point; the other data structures
 *    are not updated.
 *
 *    Saving out a design is similar, except the process runs in reverse:
 *
 * -# The program loops over all cells in GtkSheet, and sticks the
 *    values found into SHEET_DATA. Handling issues like added/deleted
 *    columns happens first at the GtkSheet, and then to SHEET_DATA and
 *    TOPLEVEL. I've kind of forgotten how I implemented these feaures,
 *    however. :-S
 * -# Then, the program loops over the cells in SHEET_DATA, and updates
 *    the attributes in TOPLEVEL using functions from libgeda, as well as by
 *    reaching directly into the TOPLEVEL data structure (a software
 *    engineering no-no). If a previously existing attrib has been removed,
 *    then it is removed from TOPLEVEL. If a new attrib has been attached
 *    to a component, then it is added to TOPLEVEL.
 * -# Then the design is saved out using the save function from
 *    libgeda.
 *
 * Therefore, think of SHEET_DATA and the other gattrib data structures
 * as a thin layer between GtkSheet and TOPLEVEL. The gattrib data
 * structures are used basically for convenience while trying to build or
 * update either of the two other, more important data structures.
