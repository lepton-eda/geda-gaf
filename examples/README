    gTAG is an interface to connect your USB port of computer to talk
    to your circuits which talks JTAG.

    See gTAG/README and gTAG/ChangeLog for more information.

    gTAG shows off how to do hierarchical schematics in gEDA/gaf.

    This unit flashes a lamp, the brightness proportional to the
    range/power of lightning.

    lightning detector shows off how to use gEDA/gaf and PCB.
    Also includes the start of a bom creator which reads sch files
    directly.


* RF_Amp - Schematics and associated materials for a
           SPICE model of Agilent's MSA-2643 bipolar amp.

    This project exemplifies construction of a hierarchical SPICE
    simulation using gEDA.  You may have edit some paths to get the
    examples to netlist.


* TwoStageAmp - A Two stage amplifier SPICE playpen

    Author: Stuart Brorson

    This example shows how to do gEDA SPICE netlisting with SPICE
    models, includes, and directives.  You may have edit some paths
    to get the examples to netlist.
