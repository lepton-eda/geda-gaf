    gTAG is an interface to connect your USB port of computer to talk
    to your circuits which talks JTAG.

    See gTAG/README and gTAG/ChangeLog-1.0 for more information.

    gTAG shows off how to do hierarchical schematics in Lepton EDA.

    This unit flashes a lamp, the brightness proportional to the
    range/power of lightning.

    lightning detector shows off how to use Lepton EDA and PCB
    printed circuit board layout editor (http://pcb.geda-project.org).


* RF_Amp - Schematics and associated materials for a
           SPICE model of Agilent's MSA-2643 bipolar amp.
