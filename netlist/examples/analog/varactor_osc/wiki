notes:

FFT does a fft analysis on the vecs spicified. This is of course complex and 
requires mag, just like bandpass example. You can also just look at transient 
analysis which should be REAL and see the wave form.
Both can be viewed with gaw, gwave or built in viewer in ngpsice.

You will find the schematics and the custom symbols. The models directory contain the models for the project.
